# HUFFMAN ENCODER AND DECORDER

Huffman encoding is a method used for lossless data compression, primarily in the field of information theory and data compression. It was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a student at MIT in 1952. In Huffman encoding, each character or symbol in the input data is assigned a variable-length binary code, with shorter codes assigned to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes assigned to less frequently occurring characters. This way, the most common characters are represented by shorter bit sequences, leading to overall compression of the data. The process of generating a Huffman code involves constructing a binary tree called a Huffman tree. This tree is built using a frequency-based algorithm, where characters with higher frequencies are placed closer to the root of the tree, and characters with lower frequencies are placed farther away. Traversing the tree from the root to each character generates the binary code for that character. Huffman encoding is used in various applications where data compression is necessary, such as in file compression algorithms like ZIP, as well as in network protocols, image compression, and more. It is particularly effective when there are distinct differences in the frequencies of different symbols within the data, allowing for significant reduction in the size of the encoded data without loss of information.
